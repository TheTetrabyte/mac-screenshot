# Mac Screenshot

This is a quick script I wrote for use with [Spark](https://www.shadowlab.org/softwares/spark.php) and AppleScript to have a keybind

This takes a region screenshot and will save it to `Pictures/Screenshots/YEAR/MONTH/DAY/TIME-DATE.png` then it will upload it to a host using curl and show a notification with the link letting you know it was a successful upload, it will also copy it to the clipboard
